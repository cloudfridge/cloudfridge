CloudFridge is an open source operating system for refrigeration systems.

CloudFridge introduces open source software and hardware to provide a way to operate a refrigeration system 
in a cloud computing environment. Instead of a factory pre-configured control loop, CloudFridge allows the 
use of sophisticated control software and the power of cloud computing to remotely operate a refrigeration system, 
optimize for energy consumption and push efficiency to new limits.
